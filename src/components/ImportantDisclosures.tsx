            The services offered by this website are administrative only
            (frequently referred to as “lead generation”) and are offered to you
            free of charge. Lenders and other financial service providers pay a
            fee to be connected to consumers in search of financial services,
            often based on a ping tree model similar to Google AdWords where
            the highest available bidder is connected to the consumer. In some
            cases, you may be given the option of being connected to a tribal
            lending enterprise (“TLE”). TLEs are subject to tribal and certain
            federal laws while being immune from state law including usury caps.
            If you are connected to a TLE, please understand that the tribal
            lender’s rates and fees may be higher than state-licensed lenders.
            Additionally, TLEs may require you to agree to dispute resolution in
            a tribal jurisdiction.
